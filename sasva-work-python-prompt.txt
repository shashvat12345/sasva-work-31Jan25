Create a simple webapp using Python, Flask, HTML and mongodb that allows user to sign-up, sign-in and logout on the UI.
This app must be created under virtual environment. Create a new Python vertual environment and install python libraries as needed.
While installing libraries use --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org as part of "pip install" command.
e.g. "pip install Flask --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org"
As part of "how to run the app" instruct user to activate the virtual environment.
 
New users would sign-up and type in user-name and password in plain text. 
Entered information should get saved in MongoDB database in plan text. Do not hash passwords. 
Make sure that username is unique in the database. If user attempts to use existing username he should be asked to "choose another".
Notify the new users when sign-up process is successful for about 4 seconds and then redirect them to sign-in page.

Existing users would sign-in. If they enter correct credentials display welcome page and a logout button using which they can logout. If they enter wrong credentials notify them on the UI and allow them to re-enter the credentials.

MongoDB database is running on local host port 27017.
As part of the code create a client to connect to MongoDB using MongoClient which uses "localhost" and port 27017.
Create a new mongodb database named LoginInfo2 if it does not already exist. If it exists use as it is.
Create or use existing collection name as "users".

==================
This creates a skeleton app that runs. It goes on asking you to test after implementing a feature.
If something is not working it asks you expected Vs Current behaviour and fixes the issue if well described.

At the end it will ask you if you wish to add another feature OR CReate a repo.

MongoDB connection would look like...

try: 
    client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017) 
    db = client['LoginInfo2']  # Create or use existing database 
    users_collection = db['users']  # Create or use existing collection 
    logging.info("MongoDB connection established successfully.") 
except Exception as e: 
    logging.error("Error connecting to MongoDB: %s", e, exc_info=True) 








app.config['MONGO_URI'] = 'your_mongodb_connection_string'  # INPUT_REQUIRED {MongoDB connection string} 
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'  # INPUT_REQUIRED {Secret key for session management} 
app.config['SESSION_TYPE'] = 'filesystem' 


mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+2.3.8
loginUsers

Collection name: login_password
